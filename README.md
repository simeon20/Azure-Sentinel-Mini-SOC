# Azure-Sentinel-Mini-SOC
Built an end-to-end Microsoft Sentinel detection pipeline: onboarded a Linux VM via AMA (DCR) to ingest Syslog, enabled Azure Activity via policy, wrote KQL parsers, created two Scheduled Analytics (SSH brute force &amp; Azure delete), verified incidents in Defender, and built a workbook dashboard. Includes JSON exports &amp; KQL queries.
